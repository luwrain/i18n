# National languages and standards


You can find here all language-dependent code used in LUWRAIN.
It is mostly responsible for the support of various national languages and standards.
A vast majority of prepared translation saved in a set of properties files with static strings.
You can find such files for the following languages:

* [English](https://github.com/luwrain/i18n/blob/master/en/src/main/resources/org/luwrain/i18n/en/constants.properties)
* [French](https://github.com/luwrain/i18n/blob/master/fr/src/main/resources/org/luwrain/i18n/fr/constants.properties)
* [Romanian](https://github.com/luwrain/i18n/blob/master/ro/src/main/resources/org/luwrain/i18n/ro/constants.properties)
* [Russian](https://github.com/luwrain/i18n/blob/master/ru/src/main/resources/org/luwrain/i18n/ru/constants.properties)
* (we also have some materials for Chech language, but they need more arranging)

In the meantime, some coding in Java for any particular language is still needed anyway.
Of course, it is very important to us to find everybody who is willing to add the support of any new language.
